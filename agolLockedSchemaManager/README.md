**schemaLockTool**<br><br>
ArcGIS Online Joined Feature Layer Views contain an attribute that prevents editing, addition, or removal of fields to the source feature service. This is done, generally, to prevent source changes from damaging the functionality of an existing joined view. However, there are many cases where a user needs to be able to add/remove fields or even update domain lists. <br><br>**schemaLockTool.py** provides a quick set of callable methods as a wrapper for the ArcGIS API for Python that edits the "sourceSchemaChangesAllowed" attribute on all views associated with given feature service/hosted feature layer. This allows a user to make needed changes and then "relock" the schema to prevent other unintentional changes that may otherwise break joined views.
